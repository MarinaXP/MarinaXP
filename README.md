ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Marina â€“ Business Advisor

With over 10 years of experience, I am dedicated to helping businesses grow. My approach is simple: I believe that by equipping people with the right tools, they can optimize their work. This philosophy drove me to create Trash2Tech, a project that proves technology can be made accessible to everyone, pushing the boundaries of creativity and practicality.
